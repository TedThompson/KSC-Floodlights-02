* Adds 3 Floodlight Towers to the KSC Launchpad. ([Requires Kerbal Konstructs MOD](https://github.com/KSP-RO/Kerbal-Konstructs))

## Description

Using the mesh file so generously supplied by Stone Blue, I have remixed yet another version of the lightning arrester / floodlight tower for the launch pad as KSC.

Once installed alongside Kerbal Konstructs (and it's dependencies) it will create 3 towers around the launch pad with automatic dusk/dawn operation (originally added by Stone Blue). Each tower can also be manually toggled (with satisfying sound effects) by clicking on the tower it's self.

## Changes from previous versions

It remains somewhat over-sized (my placements, like Stone Blue's, scales the towers to 0.7 of their original size), but I did make the following alterations:
* Resized / Re-meshed the lamp panel border.
* Added "struts" to support the lamp panel.
* Reduced range and altered power to provide a lower light level more in line with the lighting provided by the built in water tower spotlight[^note].
* Added sound effect (powered by built in KK functionality)
* Corrected delay in tower being "ready" to be clicked again after being clicked - tower can not be clicked again as soon as the light is fully on or off.
* Altered / Re-skinned to have a white/gray coloring and detailed extinguished lamps.

## Prototype Info

| [![Tower Diagram](http://www.capcomespace.net/dossiers/espace_US/projet_constellation/2008_LC39B_plan_lightning_system_02_small.jpg)](http://www.capcomespace.net/dossiers/espace_US/projet_constellation/2008%20LC39B%20plan%20lightning%20system%2002.jpg) | In 2009, LC-39B saw the installation of three nearly 600' tall towers as part of a new "Lightning Protection System" at the historic launch pad. Previous uses for Apollo and the Space Shuttle did not have such comprehensive protection. These towers, meant to be a more attractive target for "Zeus", are by necessity significantly taller than the launch vehicles they protect. They are painted a light gray color from top to bottom and hold cables aloft to harmlessly redirect electrical discharges to the ground and away from launch vehicles. |

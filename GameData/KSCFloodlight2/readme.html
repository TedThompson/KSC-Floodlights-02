<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Using the mesh file so generously supplied by Stone Blue, I have remixed yet another version of the lightning arrester / floodlight tower for the launch pad as KSC.</p>
<p>Once installed alongside Kerbal Konstructs (and it&#39;s dependencies) it will create 3 towers around the launch pad with automatic dusk/dawn operation (originally added by Stone Blue). Each tower can also be manually toggled (with satisfying sound effects) by clicking on the tower it&#39;s self.</p>
<h2 id="changes-from-previous-versions">Changes from previous versions</h2>
<p>It remains somewhat over-sized (my placements, like Stone Blue&#39;s, scales the towers to 0.7 of their original size), but I did make the following alterations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resized / Re-meshed the lamp panel border.</li>
<li>Added &quot;struts&quot; to support the lamp panel.</li>
<li>Reduced range and altered power to provide a lower light level more in line with the lighting provided by the built in water tower spotlight[^note].</li>
<li>Added sound effect (powered by built in KK functionality)</li>
<li>Corrected delay in tower being &quot;ready&quot; to be clicked again after being clicked - tower can not be clicked again as soon as the light is fully on or off.</li>
<li>Altered / Re-skinned to have a white/gray coloring and detailed extinguished lamps.</li>
</ul>

<th style="text-align:left">In 2009, LC-39B saw the installation of three nearly 600&#39; tall towers as part of a new &quot;Lightning Protection System&quot; at the historic launch pad. Previous uses for Apollo and the Space Shuttle did not have such comprehensive protection. These towers, meant to be a more attractive target for &quot;Zeus&quot;, are by necessity significantly taller than the launch vehicles they protect. They are painted a light gray color from top to bottom and hold cables aloft to harmlessly redirect electrical discharges to the ground and away from launch vehicles.</th>
